    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Cantonese steamed fish is a traditional, simple dish often served as one of the final courses in a Chinese wedding banquet</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 scallions</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ginger</li>
        <li>1 small bunch cilantro</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons light soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons hot water</li>
        <li>10 ounce fillet of delicate white fish</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the scallions into 2-inch lengths, and cut the pieces in half lengthwise. Julienne them thinly. Thinly slice about 15g of ginger, and julienne them. Give the cilantro a rough chop. Set the aromatics aside.</li>
        <li>Combine the light soy sauce, salt, sugar and hot water in a small bowl and mix until the sugar and salt are dissolved. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Prepare your steaming set-up, and fill with 1-2 inches of water. Bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Rinse your fish fillet, and carefully lay it on an oblong heat-proof plate that will fit into your wok or steaming setup. Carefully place it in the steamer, and adjust the heat to medium. The water should be at a slow boil that generates a good amount of steam, but not so high that the water evaporates too quickly.</li>
        <li>Cover and steam for 7-10 minutes depending upon the size and thickness of your fish fillet. If you have extremely small, thin fillets (half an inch), cook for 4-5 minutes. Check for doneness using a butter knife. If it falls easily through the thickest part of the fillet to the bottom of the plate, the fish is done.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat, and carefully drain any liquid on the plate. Spread about ⅓ of the scallions, ginger, and cilantro on the steamed fish (alternatively, you can wait to do this AFTER adding the sauce).</li>
        <li>To make the sauce, heat a wok or small saucepan to medium high heat, and add 2 tablespoons vegetable oil. Add the remaining ⅔ of the ginger, and fry for 1 minute. Add the white parts of the scallions and cook for 30 seconds.Then add rest of the scallions and cilantro. The mixture should be sizzling.</li>
        <li>Add the soy sauce mixture. Bring the mixture to a bubble, and cook until the scallions and cilantro are just wilted, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Pour this mixture over the fish. If you prefer to add the raw aromatics after adding the sauce, you can do so now, and heat an additional 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil to pour over the raw aromatics. Serve immediately!</li>
